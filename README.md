> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
You be complicated
I ain't got no time to play
You can't call me baby
If you keep acting that way
I won't tell you twice
Better make up your mind in life
Better say what you need to say
You gon be mad if I walk away
You can try to find a type
But they only made it one time
You know it's me, it only gets better
But, I can't sit and wait forever
You ain't no good
I ain't gon lie
You got me hoping
Wish you would
You know what's good
And what I like
So come and treat me
Like you should
Oh, don't deny
yourself a good life
Baby let me
Love you one time
You know I'm cool
You know I'm fly
You know I'm
Bringing you that time
You know what's good
Know whachu like
I do my thing
I do that nice
So baby, don't deny
yourself a real good life
Baby let me
Love you one time
I got everything you need
So what's it gonna be
Ain't no other girl gon love you
Like me, you see
I'm the best you ever had
I'm a stallion, I'm a swag
Yeah, it's so good you need to
Throw it in a bag
You can try to find a type
But they only made it one time
You know it's me, it only gets better
But, I can't sit and wait forever
You ain't no good
I ain't gon lie
You got me hoping
Wish you would
You know what's good
And what I like
So come and treat me
Like you should
Oh, don't deny
yourself a good life
Baby let me
Love you one time
You know I'm cool
You know I'm fly
You know I'm
Bringing you that time
You know what's good
Know whachu like
I do my thing
I do that nice
So baby, don't deny
yourself a real good life
Baby let me
Love you one time
Don't deny yourself
Baby let me love
Don't deny yourself a real good life
Baby let me
Love you one time
