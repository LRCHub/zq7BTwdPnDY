[00:14.33] Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt
[00:18.50] Your rolled up sleeves in your skull T-shirt
[00:22.93] You say "what did you do it with him today?"
[00:27.30] And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
[00:46.80] 
[00:31.22] 'Cause you're my fella, my guy
[00:37.54] Hand me your Stella and fly
[00:42.14] By the time I'm out the door
[00:46.34] You tear me down like Roger Moore
[01:02.84] 
[00:50.51] I cheated myself
[00:55.56] Like I knew I would
[01:00.58] I told you I was trouble
[01:04.96] You know that I'm no good
[01:17.46] 
[01:10.19] Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
[01:19.17] He's in a place, but I can't get joy
[01:23.55] Thinking on you in the final throes
[01:28.58] This is when my buzzer goes
[01:42.08] 
[01:33.54] Run out to meet your chips and pita
[01:37.92] You say when "we're married"
[01:40.82] 'Cause you're not bitter
[01:42.98] "There'll be none of him no more"
[01:47.17] I cried for you on the kitchen floor
[02:05.17] 
[01:51.94] I cheated myself
[01:55.96] Like I knew I would
[02:00.95] I told you I was trouble
[02:05.54] You know that I'm no good
[02:18.04] 
[02:30.40] Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
[02:34.56] We're like how we were again
[02:38.31] I'm in the tub, you on the seat
[02:43.37] Lick your lips as I soak my feet
[02:59.37] 
[02:47.93] Then you notice little carpet burn
[02:51.78] My stomach drop and my guts churn
[02:57.91] You shrug and it's the worst
[03:01.94] Who truly stuck the knife in first
[03:18.94] 
[03:06.72] I cheated myself
[03:10.51] Like I knew I would
[03:14.76] I told you I was trouble
[03:19.56] You know that I'm no good
[03:32.06] 
[03:24.35] I cheated myself
[03:29.11] Like I knew I would
[03:34.57] I told you I was troubled
[03:39.12] Yeah, you know that I'm no good
