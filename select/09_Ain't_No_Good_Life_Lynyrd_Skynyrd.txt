Ain't no good life
Not the one that I lead
'Cause the more I fight the sadness yeah
It only seems the more that I grieve

Well I always look back on the good times
As some lost part of me
I wanna know
Tell me why is it so

Well just because I don't pray
Lord that don't mean I ain't forgiven
Just 'cause I'm alive
That don't mean I'm makin' a livin'

I'm gonna get myself together
I'm gonna try a dyin' attempt
Talkin' about the good times slippin' by
Yeah I'll tell ya now
I don't even know where last month went

Well I can't make no money baby
Well 'cause my money's already spent
And I know where it went
I said it went on that damn rent

Well I, I don't mean change
Baby I need folding money
When I want a lover said I don't need a buddy
Well I don't need nobody now (Woo)

Ain't exactly my idea
It's sort of old borrowed and blue
I'm just tryin' to say don't try that straight life buddy
Well you'll find it kind of hard on you

Women don't try to cook nothin' up (Ooh)
Brother you know you'll only wind up in your own stew
Just don't let nobody tell you
Oh what you oughta do
