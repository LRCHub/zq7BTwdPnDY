Daddy told me look into the future
Sit at your computer, be a good girl
And Mama said remember you're a lady,
Think before your play and straighten your curls,

Well everybody's talking like i'm crazy
Dangerous and lazy girl with no soul
But I've seen it all from where i'm hiding
Baby cos I'm sliding, out of control

(BRIDGE)
Here I go, on the road, crank the stereo
I flick my finger to the world below
Here I am, dirty hands, I don't give a damn
Shut your mouth because it might show

(CHORUS)
I don't need no good advice
I'm already wasted
I don't need some other life
Cold and complicated
I don't need no Sunday trips
Tea and sympathising
I don't need no special fix
To anaesthetise me

Daddy always told me to remember,
Leave the boys til later, don't you drop down
Mama said I'd never get to heaven
Hanging til eleven, with the wrong crowd

Everybody's talking like I'm only
Just another phony girl with no place
But I dig the music that i'm making
Baby and I'll break it into your brain

(BRIDGE)
Here I go, on the road, crank the stereo
I flick my finger to the world below
Here I am, dirty hands, I don't give a damn
Shut your mouth because it might show

(CHORUS)
I don't need no good advice
I'm already wasted
I don't need some other life
Cold and complicated
I don't need no Sunday trips
Tea and sympathising
I don't need no special fix
To anaesthetise me

(BRIDGE)
Here I go, on the road, crank the stereo
I flick my finger to the world below
Here I am, dirty hands, I don't give a damn
Shut your mouth because might show

(CHORUS)
I don't need no good advice
I'm already wasted
I don't need some other life
Cold and complicated
I don't need no Sunday trips
Tea and sympathising
I don't need no special fix
To anaesthetise me

I don't need no good advice
No well-intentioned sacrifice
And I don't need no Sunday trips
No chocolate box or speed for kicks
Hell I don't need no beauty sleep
No need to count those dirty sheep
And I don't need no bedtime prayer
Cos frankly I don't even care
