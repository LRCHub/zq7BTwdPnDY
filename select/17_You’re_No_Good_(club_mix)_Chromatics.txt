Do I know youre no good, no
But I cant stay awway from you
I know youre no good, no
But I cant stay away from you

Thats all we ever do
Thats all we ever do
Thats all we ever do
Thats all we ever do

Ever do

We sleep until the sun goes down
We watch the night fall on the ground
And are we all alone

I know youre no good, no
But I cant stay away from you

Do
Do
Do
I cant stay away from you

They close their eyes and touch the flame
Wonder why
Seeking shelter from the rain
Dont you cry

And are we all alone
Tears like satin
Felt before
Thirsty vampires
Costing more

And are we all alone
I know youre no goood, no
But I cant stay away from you
I know youre no good, no
I cant stay away from you

From you (Do)
From you (Do)
I cant stay away from you (do)
From you (do)
From you (do)
From you (stay away, stay away)

Do
